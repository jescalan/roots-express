It's a child of the [roots build system](http://github.com/jenius/roots-cli), but is totally old enough to live on it's own. It can be integrated as a plugin for stylus or included manually.\n\nDetailed documentation coming soon. The code is commented pretty thoroughly though, if you want to comb through it.",
